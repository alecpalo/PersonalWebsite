## Hello!
This is a project that I am taking on to better learn tsx, next.js and tailwindcss. This will be for me to showcase what I am working on right now and things that I am interested in. Additionally, there will be a blog component so that I can go more in depth into certain topics.

I am not an expert in front end development so I am sure there will be better ways of doing many things in this website. I am more than willing to recieve feedback and learn!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
